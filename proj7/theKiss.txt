The Kiss
R. Lamoureux

When you kissed me
A fool fell in love
I became weak in the knees
The world revolved around your halo
Angel eyes captured my imagination
Like Einstein I discovered relativity 
Wisdom had been my lonely pathway
Drunk on independent thought
Wondering if those lips would part for me
Wanting to breathe your breath
Gazing longingly 
I looked towards you
So quickly
You looked away 
my heart sank
When you kissed another boy
